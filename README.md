# Simple-Summarizer
A simple summarizer in Python 

## About
This is an extremely basic summarizer that uses the NLTK for Python to summarize the contents of a plain text file it is given. The sanitation is not very smart yet so it can only handle basically plain text. It accepts a required parameter of a file path to the file that needs to be summarized and an optional length paramter for how many sentences need to be in the final summary; the default being four. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.X
* NLTK Library
* NLTK Corpus
